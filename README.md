# IOT-Application

## Application report
Within this appliction I created my first react project, including displaying data from a physical object (arduino) using pubnub to relay that data. The project was for the my 2nd year IoT module and based around the reading of bin data, calculating how full a bin was and thus allowing the relevant services to waste less time and collect those bins which need more attention or are more popular, it would also be an idea to see where recycling and other items are more used by users. Especially within a university setting.
